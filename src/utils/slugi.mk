Slugify is a process of converting a string (like a book title) into a URL-friendly format, often called a "slug."
 A slug is a part of a URL that is easy to read, SEO-friendly, and safe for use in web addresses.

For example:

Original title: "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
Slugified title: "alices-adventures-in-wonderland"
The slugified version removes special characters, replaces spaces with hyphens (-), and converts the text to lowercase.


Why Use Slugify?
Readability: URLs with slugs are easier for users to read and understand.

Example: /book/OL138052W/alices-adventures-in-wonderland is more descriptive than /book/OL138052W.
SEO Benefits: Search engines like Google prefer URLs that include meaningful keywords (like the book title).

URL Safety: Slugifying ensures that the URL does not contain special characters or spaces, which can cause issues in web browsers.

Example Slugify Function
Here’s a simple implementation of a slugify function in JavaScript/TypeScript:

const slugify = (title: string): string => {
  return title
    .toLowerCase() // Convert to lowercase
    .replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, "-") // Replace non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens
    .replace(/^-|-$/g, ""); // Remove leading or trailing hyphens
};

How It Works
Convert to Lowercase:

"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" → "alice's adventures in wonderland"
Replace Non-Alphanumeric Characters:

Replace spaces, apostrophes, and other special characters with hyphens (-).
"alice's adventures in wonderland" → "alice-s-adventures-in-wonderland"
Remove Leading/Trailing Hyphens:

Ensure there are no unnecessary hyphens at the start or end of the string.
"alice-s-adventures-in-wonderland" → "alice-s-adventures-in-wonderland"
